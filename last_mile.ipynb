    "This is very famous and recurring problem in logistics and supply chain management. The problem is about how you can find the optimal schedule for delivering goods from transportation hub to delivery destination. The optimality criteria of this problem and its objectives are very diverse and contradicting like we want to look at the cost of the delivery routes and the time window of the delivery to many destinations and don't forget the dynamic nature of navigation and routing problems and what if the vehicle needs to go back .\n",

    "This is problem is pretty much like traveling salesman problem in the sense that you need to visit all delivery destination only once in the most optimal way based on your objectives. There is only one relaxed condition in TSP formulation which is that you can visit the transportation hub multiple times because you probably can't serve all delivery destinations demands with loading the vehicle one time, so you need to go back to the transportation hub multiple times between deliveries to load more goods.\n",

    "As you probably see, the last mile delivery problem with a single transportation hub and arbitrary number of delivery destinations is trivial and its running time for generating new solutions and getting their cost was rather fast because all you have to do is just manipulating a single array of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "But handling multiple transportation hubs is completely different beast. The problem could be solved by reducing the problem to a network flow problem, where we would have bipartite graph with two different vertex sets: the first one is the set containing all the delivery destinations and the other set containing all transportation hubs. Your problem is to find the maximum flow and maximum matching between the tranportation hub vertices and delivery destinations vertices and you can add the constraints like time windows and capacity of the vehicles as extra layer of vertices between the layer of transportation hubs and the layer of vertices of delivery destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving your problem as flow problem will give you the **exact** solution for the scheduling and you don't need to resort for approximations most of the time. Linear programming is used to solve these kind of problems, but you need to be aware that linear programming solutions sometimes under some conditions can degenerate to exponential and intractable problems, in that case we resort to approximation search algorithms like SA and genetic algorithm."
